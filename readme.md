### TODO:
- Generate cells with custom distributions for different defects e.g. evenly distributed Nitrogen
- Create defect class -> some of their creations should be linked i.e. vacancy and interstitial
- Figure out best way to do large vacancies e.g. are they coupled or linked as one?
- Output things moving in extxyz so can be visualised in Ovito
- Representing mobile vs immobile defects
- Positions should be arrays so e.g. divac has 2 arrays
- Or divac can just have one position, things are *so* far away I don't even think it matters that much for now
